## Product Info
This is the Sherpa Heavy Extruder, a ground up design developed by Anlin and the team at Annex Engineering, that is based on the "original Sherpa Mini extruder". It's a dual geared hobbed filament extruder designed for use with any extremely high flow rate printers. It features a 50:8 gear driven design to provide enough torque to push filament at upwards of 100mm^3/s through a Slice Engineering Mag+ or similar hotend. You must perform your own tuning to get the best results.

A Pinion Equipped NEMA17 Stepper is required for this Release.
