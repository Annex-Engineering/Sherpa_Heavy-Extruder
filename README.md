## Product Info
We are excited to finally introduce Sherpa Heavy to the mainline, the performance flagship of the Sherpa lineup. Designed for applications requiring extreme performance at high speeds, Sherpa Heavy uses a modified Sherpa Mini housing and a 7T NEMA17 motor co-developed and produced by LDO Motors. With a pushing force in excess of 160N, Sherpa Heavy eliminates the extruder as a performance bottleneck. And with a footprint only slightly longer than a Sherpa Mini and weighing in at 160g, it is still small and light enough to be used in a direct drive configuration. 

Please note that Sherpa Heavy is a speciality product for high performance printers. For most users, Sherpa Mini provides more than sufficient performance and strikes a better balance between size, weight and power

A Pinion Equipped NEMA17 Stepper is required for this Release.
